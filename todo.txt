Game genie codes: http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?StartRow=1&catid=31&threadid=34751

- MMC1 - better distinction between SUROM, SOROM, SXROM - http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC1
- MMC3 - add blarg mmc6 test to DB
- MMC3: Differentiate between Rev A and Rev B boards using DB
- MMC3: Need to remove sync irq event on mapper unload (otherwise irqs will be fired in other games loaded afterwards!)
- automatically save sram
- check this.status in cpu class?? should it be replaced with this.regStatus?
- read in 'perherials' section of db and set up game accordingly
- allow player to select game genie codes in UI
- debug methods that can be invoked in console - also setting of breakpoints
- allow selection if zip file has multiple nes files in
DONE - refactor mmc5 code so scanline end notification is no longer required, it works it out itself
- 7z support? https://github.com/cscott/lzma-purejs
DONE - save states are loaded per ROM using the sha hash, so wrong state cant be loaded for different rom
- Refactor cartridge.js so detection / db lookup code is outside rom loading stuff
DONE - Automatic NTSC/PAL detection using filename & db 'region' attribute
HALF DONE - Support mapper id 5 for castlevania 3
DONE - 9 for mike tyson's punchout
